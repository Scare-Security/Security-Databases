# What is this repo 

this repo is a repository that will build over time where databases will be stored. Data such as phone number hashes, email hashes, domain hashes, passwords, OUI's and other forms of data will be stored here that can be included into your local project. Some of these databases will be in other or specific languages but that does not mean you can not translate them to a new language or your desired language.
